# SHAP AI 2022 Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes the SHAP AI 2022 dataset using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. The goal of this analysis is to interpret the predictions of a machine learning model and understand feature importance.

## Dataset

It contains information relevant for explainability in AI models.

The dataset includes multiple features contributing to machine learning predictions.

## Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions and key statistics.

Machine Learning Model Interpretation: Using SHAP values to explain model predictions.

Visualizations: Graphs and charts to illustrate feature importance.

## Results

SHAP values provide a clear understanding of how individual features impact predictions.

Key insights are derived from the dataset regarding model explainability.

## Acknowledgments

This project leverages SHAP for AI model interpretability.

Special thanks to the creators of SHAP and open-source data science tools.
